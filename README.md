# DeadPoets - The White Paper

### DeadPoet’s purpose is to help indie authors self-publish their written media as an ebook using NFT technology. Ebooks can be very diverse, ranging from novels to textbooks, zines to comics, poems to web fiction and more.

In that sense, [DeadPoets.xyz](http://deadpoets.xyz/) is a web3 application that provides 3 main services.

The “Mint-On-Demand” function serves as a self-publishing tool for authors who want to create and sell nft-books. Through the power of blockchain and NFTs, ebooks can be turned into digital assets that can be traded by their owners.

By extension, DeadPoets is also a NFT marketplace where readers can buy nft-books directly from authors and resell them to other readers if they want to. In that paradigm, the author has two ways of generating income. He earns revenue from his initial book sales and is also able to capture a royalty fee (programmed into the smart contract) every time his books get resold.

Nonetheless, DeadPoets is aiming to be more than just a minting tool and a marketplace. The ultimate vision is to build a platform for digital book clubs. It could be built like a forum where readers could comment, review and discuss topics related to their favorite body of work. All content would be user-generated and browsable within the app (to make it easier for students working on academic paper for exemple). 

The nft-books would serve as the right of access to these communities and collective minds. That framework would incentivize readers to buy and own nft-books instead of trying to acquire it buy illegal ways, because it allows them to access and contribute to all the meta-data surrounding it.
